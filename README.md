Study books

Some of my favorite study guides in PDF format. Many of these books were acquired from friends, or purchased because they were simply an amazing deal.  My favorite resources to date are udemy, plural-site, and you-tube, because they often can be hands on and give you the info you need on the need to know basis. But sometimes nothing beats the educational qualities of a good book. My favorite so far is sql-all-in-one_for_dummies.
